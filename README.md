# Trails for iOS

This is the iOS version of the Trails project.

## Installation

To obtain a version of the source code simply pull it from this repository and initialize Cocoapods.

## Cocoapods initialization

This project uses Cocoapods for dependency management. Usually the pods are excluded from Git because they can be downloaded on demand for each client. To setup Cocoapods follow the following steps:

1. Follow the tutorial here to install Cocoapods on your machine - https://cocoapods.org/
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `pod install`.
4. Once the process finished open `Trails-iOS.xcworkspace` and use that workspace from now on.
5. Make sure to exclude any new Pods when comitting to GitHub.
